<p><span class="sub">P</span>rogenitor stem cells are the repair system of the body, replenishing various types of tissues as needed. One of the primary control pathways for these cells is the Wnt signaling pathway, which can be activated or inhibited to manage the extent and type of tissue they turn into. For example, progenitor stem cells will turn into bone or cartilage, based on whether the Wnt pathway in the vicinity of the bone or joints is activated or inhibited, respectively.</p>

<p>Using unique assays and screens, Samumed (formerly known as Wintherix & Epitherix) has identified a number of novel drug compounds to selectively activate or inhibit the Wnt pathway toward regenerative medicine and treatment of oncology and degenerative diseases. Our traditional small molecule drug development approach, combined with our unique ability to control the fate of latent human progenitor stem cells has enabled us to develop a series of breakthrough potential new treatments with high potency and excellent safety profiles.</p>
